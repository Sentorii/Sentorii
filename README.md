# Sentorii 🦊
**Your friendly, interactive guide through the streams of GitFlow.**

Sentorii is a modern, cross-platform command-line tool designed to bring speed, safety, and a bit of delight to your GitFlow workflows.
It's more than just a script-runner, Sentorii is a visual assistant that takes over your terminal to provide a clear, step-by-step overview of every operation, turning complex branching logic into a calm, guided experience.

## The Sentorii Philosophy
GitFlow is a powerful branching model, but it can be verbose and error-prone. Sentorii is built on a few core principles to solve this:
* ✨ Visual & Interactive: Instead of a black box of scripts, Sentorii provides a full-screen Terminal UI (TUI) that shows you exactly what's happening, step-by-step.
* 🧠 Intelligent & Proactive: Sentorii assists you. It suggests the next version number, helps you onboard new projects, and provides clear guidance when things go wrong, like a merge conflict.
* 🛡️ Safe & Recoverable: With features like pre-command hooks for running tests and crash recovery, Sentorii helps protect your repository from common mistakes.
* 🔌 Extensible for Your World: A language-agnostic plugin system for version bumping means Sentorii can adapt to your project's tooling, whether it's Maven, NPM, UV, or something else.

## Features (The Vision)
Here is a look at what Sentorii is being built to do:
* Full GitFlow Automation: init, feature, release, and hotfix workflows.
* Cross-Platform Binary: A single, easy-to-install executable for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* Interactive TUI: A docker-compose-like experience for every command.
* Pluggable Versioning: An extensible system for bumping versions in files like pom.xml, package.json, and pyproject.toml.
* Interactive Onboarding: A smart init command that detects your project type and helps you generate a configuration file.
* Guided Conflict Resolution: A paused state that helps you safely navigate and resolve merge conflicts.
* Pre/Post Hooks: Run your own scripts (like tests or linters) before or after operations.
* Crash Recovery: Resume a failed multi-step operation with a --continue flag.
